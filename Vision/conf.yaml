DistanceAtFull: 30

# DistanceAtFull is the distance (in centimeters) that the camera
# is from the target when the target takes up the whole frame
# (width wise, not height wise)

# How PixelToCM is calculated:
# let a be the distance between the camera and the target (in centimeters)
# let b be the width of the target in pixels from the camera
# let c be the width of the image from the camera
# let e be DistanceAtFull (see above)
# d = b/c
# PixelToCM = log(e/a)/log(d)
